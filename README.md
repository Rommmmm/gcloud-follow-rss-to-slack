# gcloud-follow-rss-to-slack

info.sh, slack.sh

This script scans google cloud rss feed: https://status.cloud.google.com/feed.atom
and sends to slack all the new events on it.
make sure you you put the 2 scripts together in /backups/cloud-monitoring/info folder.
and change in slack.sh the 'SLACK-WEB-HOOK' to your real one in order it to work properly.
